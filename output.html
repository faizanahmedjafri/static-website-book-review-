<p>Have you been wondering about what 'The Secret' is, and why it took the country by storm? You're not alone. The book, which discusses the Law of Attraction and how to use it in your life, rose to the top of many bestseller lists and inspired offshoots like The Secret Gratitude Book, The Secret Day-To-Day Calendar, and its own official website. The book introduced many people to the concept that their thoughts may influence not only their actions, but the experiences that they bring into their lives as well.</p><br/>

<h2><u>Tips from The Secret:</u></h2>
<p>The Secret puts forward several ideas that are surprising, exciting, and perhaps controversial, such as:</p>
<p>If you focus your attention on achieving a goal and believe not only that you can do it, but that you already have done it, you can achieve virtually any goal you set your mind to.<br/> If you focus on what you don't want, you are inadvertently drawing that into your life. For example, if you constantly ruminate on what is stressing you, you'll actually draw more of those situations (and accompanying stressed feelings) into your life. Instead, the trick is to focus on what you do want in your life, and you'll get more of that.</p><br/>

<p>The Law of Attraction, the principle that you attract whatever you focus your energy on (good or bad), works with relationships, possessions, goals, and anything else you are able to focus on -- even your own health.</p>
<p>The book shares other insights and specific strategies to use, gives a history of the use of the Law of Attraction, and provides examples on how it's worked in the lives of various people, making it an interesting and informative read.</p><br/>

<h2><u>The Cons and Controversies of The Secret:</u> </h2>
<p> The book has caused some controversy. For example, some people believe that it conflicts with the religious values of Christianity and other major religions, while others see it as a complementary approach. The book does spend considerable time on how to use the Law of Attraction to gain an expensive car of other material possessions, and without direct action; many people have asserted that having such a focus on external things and material wealth goes against the spiritual wisdom of the Law of Attraction, reducing it to a parlor trick of sorts. And there's also been criticism of the idea that we create our own difficult circumstances in life; the obvious examples of children born into abuse or millions of people born into extreme poverty doesn't seem to fit well with that explanation of reality. The Law of Attraction itself can be controversial, as it's not a scientifically proven 'law', but more of an anecdotally observed phenomenon.</P><br/>
<h2><u>The Secret</u></h2>
<p>I am reading ""The Secret"" and find it fascinating and in accordance with many teachings I learned 3 - 4 years ago. In fact, these teachings are not new. The difference that I see is that the author takes a more scientific approach in that she has added the news scientific findings as to how thought affects energy. Thus, she backs up the validity and truth of her claims. It's a wonderful book but not at all new. The author has simply fine tuned and better explained an age old known subject, and she did a marvelous job. Love the book.
